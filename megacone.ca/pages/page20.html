Jobs. Steve was impressed. He did not know much about engineering, but he could see
there was a demand for having a computer to write software for, a computer for software hobbyists. He was especially excited to see that a lot
of the qualified engineers at Homebrew were talking about Woz’s computer with admiration. So he suggested to sell it to them. He and Woz would
assemble the computers themselves and sell the whole board at Homebrew meetings.

<h2>“Our own company”</h2>

<blockquote>
Steve had a good argument. We were in his car and he said — and I can remember him saying this like it was yesterday: “Well, even if we lose money, we’ll have a company. For once in our lives, we’ll have a company.” That convinced me. And I was excited to think about us like that. To be two best friends starting a company.
